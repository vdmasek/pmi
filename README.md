## Assignment structure ##

###### !NOTE: Provide insights as a Q&A slide for the assignment at the end of the project <> Try to limit between 8-12 slides!
###### !NOTE: Prepare the sources in a ranked order of how relevant it was for the assignment +  relevance in terms of sources (as close to PMI directly).
###### !NOTE: See how far I can use tech like ELK for visualizing data even before I receive it.

** If I __more__ time, it could be an option that the assignment code is prepared and sent via github / bitbucket, but I can still work on preparing the presentation + Kibana and Elastic types.


#### A. Pre assignment data
* collect relevant data about the company as a whole
* plot some basic data about PMI and its competitors
* make basic inference about past data:
  * can collect ROI data
  * cashflow data
  * stack exchange data <> see Quandl <> check Kaggle.


#### B. Post assignment data
* See if there is a theme / story.
* Build around the theme if provided, else timebox some 1-2 hours to plan it in.
* Inspect the datasets and figure out what the data is about (hopefully not geo data).
* Figure out:
  * analysis plan: what are the potential problems I can solve with the data and what is interesting to investigate ?
  * Setup a goals, preferably: ambitious & realistic. (It's more about execution for sure at this point. A good attitude about realism and delivery is probably appreciated.)
  * available data for the assignment:
    * what data can I use for which goal?
    * how do I prioritize the goals?
    * how do I trade-off between fast and proper delivery vs. over-ambitious


### The slides need to be a crystal clear summary, with backup slides for curious minds.
